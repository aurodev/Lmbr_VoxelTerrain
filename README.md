This is a repo for a voxel terrain gem. It requires the PR https://github.com/aws/lumberyard/pull/426 in order to be used and a few more libs. It uses the voxel handling library voxigen https://github.com/caseymcc/voxigen.  

This is an early work and currently you just have voxels rendering. If you would like to work on or with this gem please contact me on the Discord channel above and I can work you though.
